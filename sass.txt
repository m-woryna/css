Sass is a CSS pre-processor.
Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.

------------------
/* Define standard variables and values for website */
$bgcolor: lightblue;
$textcolor: darkblue;
$fontsize: 18px;

/* Use the variables */
body {
  background-color: $bgcolor;
  color: $textcolor;
  font-size: $fontsize;
}

What is Sass?
- Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
- Sass is an extension to CSS
- Sass is a CSS pre-processor
- Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
- Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
- Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
- Sass is free to download and use

A Simple Example why Sass is Useful
------------------------------------
Let's say we have a website with three main colors:

So, how many times do you need to type those HEX values? A LOT of times. And what about variations of the same colors?
Instead of typing the above values a lot of times, you can use Sass and write this:
-------------
/* define variables for the primary colors */
$primary_1: #a2b9bc;
$primary_2: #b2ad7f;
$primary_3: #878f99;

/* use the variables */
.main-header {
  background-color: $primary_1;
}

.menu-left {
  background-color: $primary_2;
}

.menu-right {
  background-color: $primary_3;
}
--------------------------
So, when using Sass, and the primary color changes, you only need to change it in one place.

How Does Sass Work?
*****************************
A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.

This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.

Tip: Transpiling is a term for taking a source code written in one language and transform/translate it into another language.

Sass File Type
********************
Sass files has the ".scss" file extension.

Sass Comments
**************
Sass supports standard CSS comments /* comment */, and in addition it supports inline comments // comment:

Sass Example
------------------
/* define primary colors */
$primary_1: #a2b9bc;
$primary_2: #b2ad7f;

/* use the variables */
.main-header {
  background-color: $primary_1; // here you can put an inline comment
}
